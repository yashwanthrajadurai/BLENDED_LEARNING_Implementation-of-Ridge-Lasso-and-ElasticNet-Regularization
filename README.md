# BLENDED_LEARNING
# Implementation of Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet Regularization for Predicting Car Price

## AIM:
To implement Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regularization models using polynomial features and pipelines to predict car price.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
```
1.Import Libraries:
  Use pandas for data handling and scikit-learn for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation tasks.

2.Dataset Loading:
  Load the dataset from encoded_car_data.csv.

3.Feature and Target Selection:
  Separate the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).

4.Data Splitting:
  Split the dataset into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio.

5.Model and Pipeline Definition:
  Construct pipelines for Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regression models, incorporating polynomial feature transformation with a degree of 2.

6.Model Training:
  Train each regression model pipeline using the training data.

7.Prediction Generation:
  Use the trained models to predict car prices on the test set.

8.Model Evaluation:
  Evaluate each model’s performance by calculating metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Select relevant features and target variable
X = df.drop(columns=['price'])  # All columns except 'price'
